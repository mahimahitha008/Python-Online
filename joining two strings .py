#we can join by using '+' or ',' but if we use + there will be no space between two strings but by using , we will get space between two strings
print("concatena"+"tion")
print("Hello","World")
print('I am', 59)
# if we use '+'between a string and an int there will be an error as we cant add string and int
'''print('I am'+59)'''
print('I am','59')
#same can be printed when we used both in strings
